## Welcome to Liasm
An experimental indie game project, based on the concept of combining the following gameplay elements:

- proceduarly generated 
- open world
- roguelike
- rpg
- turn based
- survival-horror
- strategy
- card game

The game is currently in early development phase, and being developed individually by me as a hobby. During this process, the game mechanincs and contents may change.

### News
Currently, I'm working on a new, polished version of the game using an actual game engine. Because of this decision, I had to start it from scratch, so it will might take a while.
